        fullText: `They say the statues have stood there longer than the sea itself. Towering above the cliffs, silent and still, no one really knows who built them or why they’re watching. 
    But when a traveler in red appeared that morning, the fog thinned, and the wind shifted. Some say the statues moved — just a little. 
    Maybe it’s the start of something big, something ancient waking up. Or maybe, it’s just the beginning of a legend that's been waiting to be told.`,

        fullText: `The battlefield was silent, save for the wind and the heavy breath of one man. He wasn’t a king, or a chosen hero — just a tired warrior who refused to back down. 
    Before him, the beast rose like a mountain of muscle and rage, its roar shaking the sky. But he held his ground. 
    With every scar on his body, with every step he took forward, he knew this fight wasn’t about glory. 
    It was about ending something that had gone on for far too long.`,

        fullText: `The storm came fast, like the gods themselves were trying to tear the ocean apart. But the raiders didn’t stop. 
    Their sails, dark and soaked, pushed through waves taller than houses. Thunder cracked above, lightning split the sky, and still they rowed. 
    These weren’t men chasing gold. This was a fleet chasing something deeper — revenge, redemption, or maybe just the promise of a new land. 
    Whatever it was, they would face it head-on, storm or no storm.`,

        fullText: `No one really remembers when the titan was chained. Some say it was a god punished for breaking the rules. Others whisper that it volunteered — to keep something worse locked away. 
    Now, it hangs between cliffs, eyes closed, unmoving... until a storm rolled in. A flash of lightning, a crack like the sky itself splitting, and one of the chains shifted. 
    Just a little. But enough. People are watching again, wondering: What happens if it wakes up?`,

        fullText: `The forest was quiet — the kind of quiet that only comes before something terrible. Snow covered everything in white, but the air was heavy with fire and fear. 
    The knight stood alone, facing a beast no one else dared to fight. He wasn’t thinking of winning. 
    He was thinking of the people he swore to protect, of stories he'd once heard by firelight. He gripped his sword, fire licking the blade, and walked forward. 
    If he fell, at least they'd remember he tried.`,

        fullText: `Far beneath the mountains, where sunlight can’t reach, a forge glows like a second sun. This is where blades are born, armor is tested, and warriors are hardened. 
    It's not just a forge — it's a promise. Every clang of metal, every bead of sweat, is a vow that when the time comes, they’ll be ready. 
    They don’t know exactly when the war will begin, but they know it’s close. And down here, under stone and fire, they’re preparing for it.`,

        fullText: `As the sun dipped low, shadows stretched across the battlefield. A lone warrior walked into the human ranks, not because he was asked, but because he believed in the fight. 
    Around him, soldiers whispered, wondering who he was — but when the horns sounded, there was no doubt. 
    He fought like he'd been there a hundred times before. The line held. The undead fell back. 
    And for a moment, it looked like they might just win. Because sometimes, one extra sword makes all the difference.`,

    8: {
        fullText: `Snowflakes drifted through the smoke as the flames rose high. The pyre cracked and hissed, and around it, the warriors stood in silence. 
    They didn’t cry. They didn’t speak. But every one of them felt it — the loss, the love, the loyalty. 
    This wasn’t just a funeral. It was a farewell to those who gave everything. And as the fire burned, they promised: 
    We will carry this fight forward. We will make their sacrifice count.`,
